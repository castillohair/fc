Plotting Flow Cytometry Data
============================

This tutorial focuses on how to plot flow cytometry data using ``FlowCal``, particularly by using the module :mod:`FlowCal.plot`

To start, navigate to the ``examples`` directory included with FlowCal, and open a ``python`` session therein. Then, import ``FlowCal`` as with any other python module.

>>> import FlowCal

Also, import ``numpy`` and ``pyplot`` from ``matplotlib``

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Histograms
----------

Let's load the data from file ``sample029.fcs`` into an ``FCSData`` object called ``s``, and tranform all channels to arbitrary units.

>>> s = FlowCal.io.FCSData('FCFiles/sample029.fcs')
>>> s = FlowCal.transform.to_rfi(s)

One is often interested in the fluorescence distribution across a population of cells. This is represented in a histogram. Since ``FCSData`` is a numpy array, one could use the standard ``hist`` function included in matplotlib. Alternatively, ``FlowCal`` includes its own histogram function specifically tailored to work with ``FCSData`` objects. For example, one can plot the contents of the ``FL1`` channel with a single call to :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d`.

>>> FlowCal.plot.hist1d(s, channel='FL1')
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_hist1d_1.png

:func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` behaves mostly like a regular matplotlib plotting function: it will plot in the current figure and axis. The axes labels are populated by default, but one can still use ``plt.xlabel`` and ``plt.ylabel`` to change them.

By default, :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` uses something called *logicle* scaling for the x axis. This scaling allows visualization of high fluorescence values with logarithmic spacing, and low fluorescence values with a more linear spacing. In some modern flow cytometers, negative events may be present, and logicle scaling allows visualization of those as well. This can be changed to a more conventional linear or logarithmic scale by using the ``xscale`` argument. In addition, :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` uses 256 uniformly spaced bins by default. We can override the default bins using the ``bins`` argument. Let's try using 1024 logarithmically-spaced bins.

>>> FlowCal.plot.hist1d(s, channel='FL1', xscale='log', bins=1024)
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_hist1d_2.png

Finally, :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` can plot several FCSData objects at the same time. Let's now load 3 FCSData objects, transform all channels to a.u., and plot the ``FL1`` channel of all three with transparency.

>>> filenames = ['FCFiles/sample{:03d}.fcs'.format(i + 33) for i in range(3)]
>>> d = [FlowCal.io.FCSData(filename) for filename in filenames]
>>> d = [FlowCal.transform.to_rfi(di) for di in d]
>>> FlowCal.plot.hist1d(d, channel='FL1', alpha=0.7, bins=128)
>>> plt.legend(filenames, loc='upper left')
>>> plt.show()

Density Plots
-------------

It is also common to look at the forward scatter and side scatter values in a 2D histogram, scatter plot, or density diagram. From those, the user can extract size and shape information that would allow him to differentiate between cells and debris. ``FlowCal`` includes the function :func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` for this purpose.

Let's look at the ``FSC`` and ``SSC`` channels in our sample ``s``.

>>> FlowCal.plot.density2d(s, channels=['FSC', 'SSC'])
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_density_2d_1.png

The color indicates the number of events in the region, with red indicating a bigger number than yellow and blue, in that order, by default. Similarly to :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d`, :func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` uses logicle scaling by default. In addition, :func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` applies, by default, gaussian smoothing to the density plot.

:func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` includes two visualization modes: ``mesh`` (seen above), and ``scatter``. The last one is good for distinguishing regions with few events.

>>> FlowCal.plot.density2d(s, channels=['FSC', 'SSC'], mode='scatter')
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_density_2d_2.png

The last plot shows three distinct populations. The large one in the middle corresponds to cells, whereas the ones at the left and below correspond to non-biological debris. We will see how to "gate", or select only one population, in the :doc:`gating tutorial </python_tutorial/gate>`.

Combined Histogram and Density Plots
------------------------------------

FlowCal also includes "complex plot" functions, which produce their own figure and a set of axes, and use simple ``matplotlib`` or ``FlowCal`` plotting functions to populate them.

In particular, :func:`FlowCal.plot.density_and_hist` uses :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` and :func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` to produce a combined density plot/histogram that allow the user to quickly see information about one sample. For example, let's plot the ``FSC`` and ``SSC`` channels in a density plot, and the ``FL1`` channel in a histogram. In the following, ``density_params`` and ``hist_params`` are dictionaries that are directly passed to :func:`FlowCal.plot.hist1d` and :func:`FlowCal.plot.density2d` as keyword arguments.

>>> FlowCal.plot.density_and_hist(s,
...                               density_channels=['FSC', 'SSC'],
...                               density_params={'mode':'scatter'},
...                               hist_channels=['FL1'])
>>> plt.tight_layout()
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_density_and_hist_1.png

:func:`FlowCal.plot.density_and_hist` can also plot data before and after applying gates. We will see this in the :doc:`gating tutorial </python_tutorial/gate>`.

Violin Plots
------------

Histograms, as shown above, can be used to plot and compare data from multiple samples. However, they can easily get too crowded. A more compact way is to use a violin plot, wherein vertical, normalized, symmetrical histograms ("violins") are shown centered on corresponding x-axis values. We can do this with the :func:`FlowCal.plot.violin` function.

>>> filenames = ['FCFiles/sample{:03d}.fcs'.format(i+29) for i in range(9)]
>>> d = [FlowCal.io.FCSData(filename) for filename in filenames]
>>> d = [FlowCal.transform.to_rfi(di) for di in d]
>>> atc = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 7.5, 20])
>>> FlowCal.plot.violin(data=d, channel='FL1', positions=atc, xlabel='aTc (ng/mL)', xscale='log', ylim=(1e0,2e3))
>>> plt.show()

.. image:: /_static/img/python_tutorial/python_tutorial_plot_violin_1.png

Note that the x axis has been plotted on a logarithmic scale using the ``xscale`` argument. Because data at position x=0 is specified, :func:`FlowCal.plot.violin` places it separately on the left side of the plot. In contrast, the y-axis is plotted on a ``logicle`` scale by default. However, it can be switched to ``log`` or ``linear`` using the argument ``yscale``. Horizontal violin plots can also be generated by setting the ``vert`` argument to ``False``. For more options, consult the function documentation.

"Dose response" or "transfer" functions are common in biology. These sometimes include minimum (negative) and maximum (positive) controls, and are often approximated by mathematical models. The :func:`FlowCal.plot.violin_dose_response` function can be used to plot a full dose response dataset, including min data, max data, and a mathematical model. Min and max data are illustrated to the left of the plot, and the mathematical model is correctly illustrated even when a position=0 violin is illustrated separately when ``xscale`` is ``log``.

>>> # Function specifying mathematical model
>>> def atc_sensor_model(atc_concentration):
>>>         mn = 16
>>>         mx = 170.
>>>         K  = 3.
>>>         n  = 5.
>>>         if atc_concentration <= 0:
>>>             return mx
>>>         else:
>>>             return mn + ((mx-mn)/(1+((atc_concentration/K)**n)))
>>> # Plot
>>> FlowCal.plot.violin_dose_response(
>>>     data=d,
>>>     channel='FL1',
>>>     positions=atc,
>>>     min_data=d[0],
>>>     max_data=d[-1],
>>>     model_fxn=atc_sensor_model,
>>>     xscale='log',
>>>     yscale='log',
>>>     ylim=(1e0,2e3),
>>>     draw_model_kwargs={'color':'gray',
>>>                        'linewidth':3,
>>>                        'zorder':-1,
>>>                        'solid_capstyle':'butt'})
>>> plt.xlabel('aTc Concentration (ng/mL)')
>>> plt.ylabel('FL1 Fluorescence (a.u.)')
>>> plt.show()
