Functions for transforming flow cytometry data

All transformations are of the following form::

    data_t = transform(data, channels, *args, **kwargs):

where `data` and `data_t` are NxD FCSData objects or numpy arrays,
representing N events with D channels, `channels` indicate the channels in
which to apply the transformation, and `args` and `kwargs` are
transformation-specific parameters. Each transformation function can apply
its own restrictions or defaults on `channels`.

If `data` is an FCSData object, `transform` should rescale ``data.range``
if necessary.

    Apply some transformation function to flow cytometry data.

    This function is a template transformation function, intended to be
    used by other specific transformation functions. It performs basic
    checks on `channels` and `data`. It then applies `transform_fxn` to the
    specified channels. Finally, it rescales  ``data.range`` and if
    necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : FCSData or numpy array
        NxD flow cytometry data where N is the number of events and D is
        the number of parameters (aka channels).
    channels : int, str, list of int, list of str, optional
        Channels on which to perform the transformation. If `channels` is
        None, use def_channels.
    transform_fxn : function
        Function that performs the actual transformation.
    def_channels : int, str, list of int, list of str, optional
        Default set of channels in which to perform the transformation.
        If `def_channels` is None, use all channels.

    Returns
    -------
    data_t : FCSData or numpy array
        NxD transformed flow cytometry data.

    Transform flow cytometry data to Relative Fluorescence Units (RFI).

    If ``amplification_type[0]`` is different from zero, data has been
    taken using a log amplifier. Therefore, to transform to RFI, the
    following operation is applied::

        y = a[1]*10^(a[0] * (x/r))

    Where ``x`` and ``y`` are the original and transformed data,
    respectively; ``a`` is `amplification_type` argument, and ``r`` is
    `resolution`. This will transform flow cytometry data taken with a log
    amplifier and an ADC of range ``r`` to linear RFIs, such
    that it covers ``a[0]`` decades of signal with a minimum value of
    ``a[1]``.

    If ``amplification_type[0]==0``, however, a linear amplifier has been
    used and the following operation is applied instead::

        y = x/g

    Where ``g`` is `amplifier_gain`. This will transform flow cytometry
    data taken with a linear amplifier of gain ``g`` back to RFIs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : FCSData or numpy array
        NxD flow cytometry data where N is the number of events and D is
        the number of parameters (aka channels).
    channels : int, str, list of int, list of str, optional
        Channels on which to perform the transformation. If `channels` is
        None, perform transformation in all channels.
    amplification_type : tuple or list of tuple
        The amplification type of the specified channel(s). This should be
        reported as a tuple, in which the first element indicates how many
        decades the logarithmic amplifier covers, and the second indicates
        the linear value that corresponds to a channel value of zero. If
        the first element is zero, the amplification type is linear. This
        is similar to the $PnE keyword from the FCS standard. If None, take
        `amplification_type` from ``data.amplification_type(channel)``.
    amplifier_gain : float or list of floats, optional
        The linear amplifier gain of the specified channel(s). Only used if
        ``amplification_type[0]==0`` (linear amplifier). If None,
        take `amplifier_gain` from ``data.amplifier_gain(channel)``. If
        `data` does not contain ``amplifier_gain()``, use 1.0.
    resolution : int, float, or list of int or float, optional
        Maximum range, for each specified channel. Only needed if
        ``amplification_type[0]!=0`` (log amplifier). If None, take
        `resolution` from ``len(data.domain(channel))``.
