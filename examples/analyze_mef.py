"""
FlowCal Python API example, using calibration beads data.

This script is divided in three parts. Part one loads and processes
calibration beads data from FCS files in order to obtain transformation
functions that can later be used to convert cell fluorescence to units of
Molecules of Equivalent Fluorophore (MEF). At several points in this
process, plots are generated that give insight into the relevant steps.

Part two processes data from nine cell samples and uses the MEF
transformation functions from part one to convert fluorescence of these
samples to MEF. Plots are also generated in this stage. In addition,
multi-color compensation is performed on all samples using data from
no-fluorophore and single-fluorophore control samples (NFC and SFCs).

Part three exemplifies how to use the processed cell sample data with
FlowCal's plotting and statistics modules to produce interesting plots.

For details about the experiment, samples, and instrument used, please
consult readme.txt.

    # cells as a function of aTc. (The `upper_trim_fraction` and

    # cells from each violin for aesthetic reasons. The summary statistic,
    # which is illustrated as a horizontal line atop each violin, is
    # calculated before cells are removed, though). We set `yscale` to 'log'
    # because the cytometer used to collect this data produces positive
    # integer data (as opposed to floating-point data, which can sometimes be
    # negative), so the added complexity of a logicle y-scale (which is the
    # default) is not necessary.
