"""
FlowCal Python API example, without using calibration beads data.

This script is divided in two parts. Part one processes data from nine
cell samples and generates plots of each one. In addition, multi-color
compensation is performed on all samples using data from no-fluorophore and
single-fluorophore control samples (NFC and SFCs).

Part two exemplifies how to use the processed cell sample data with
FlowCal's plotting and statistics modules to produce interesting plots.

For details about the experiment, samples, and instrument used, please
consult readme.txt.
